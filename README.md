# SQL Challenge

# Objective
The objective of this project is to transform a set of CSV data into a PostgreSQL database, model the data using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), and perform various analyses to extract meaningful insights. The database schema is designed to include tables for employees, titles, departments, department employees, department managers, and salaries.

# Data Modeling and Engineering
The data modeling phase involves creating an ERD that accurately represents the relationships between the various entities in the database. This includes defining all required columns, setting the correct data types, and establishing primary keys for each table. Additionally, foreign key constraints are used to reference related tables, ensuring the tables are correctly related.

# Data Analysis
Once the database is set up, several queries are executed to analyze the data. These queries include listing employee details, identifying employees hired in specific years, retrieving department managers and their departments, and listing employees in various departments. Furthermore, specialized queries are run to find employees with specific name patterns and to count the frequency of employee last names.
